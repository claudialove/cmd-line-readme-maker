// -- They give us an ARRAY called 'questions' What could we do with this (?) -- //
const questions = [

// -- They give us a writeToFile() FUNCTION, Looks like we may need to read/write to a file. What BUILT-IN node module will help us out with this (?) -- // 
function writeToFile(fileName, data) {

// -- This is a fairly common programming construct. They are just giving us a FUNCTION to INITIALIZE or SETUP our project parameter. It's also where we usually kick off our project flow -- //
function init() {

// -- We DEFINED our INITALIZATION FUNCTION above, here we are just kicking off (running) our program. -- //

//approach 1
//step 1: user generates git repo in git (initiates readme and clone link)
//step 2: user navigates to local directory and runs git clone in terminal 
//step 3: user gets the repo with a readme.md file
//step 4: user adds the readme-maker files in the local and runs it in the terminal: answering prompts which get handled/formatted/and written to the local readme.

//apporach 2
//step 1: user generates git repo in git (initiates readme and clone link)
//step 2: before cloning the repo, user runs readme-maker files in terminal and answers questions 
//step 3: answers get handled/formatted/ and written to the git repo in git automatically
//step 4: user can clone repo locally and already populated readme gets pulled down with first clone
